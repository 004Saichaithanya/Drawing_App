## 📖 Approach

The app was developed by:

- Utilizing the native **HTML5 Canvas API** for real-time drawing based on mouse and touch events.
- Implementing event listeners for `mousedown`, `mousemove`, `mouseup`, `touchstart`, `touchmove`, and `touchend` to track drawing actions.
- Building a responsive layout using **CSS Flexbox** and media queries to adapt seamlessly across devices.
- Styling the interface with a **modern, neumorphic-inspired UI** using CSS properties like `box-shadow`, `border-radius`, `linear-gradient`, and `transition`.
- Adding a **color picker input** and **clear button** inside a toolbar for easy user controls.

## 🎨 UI Elements & Styling Techniques

- **Toolbar:** Flexbox-based header with input and button elements.
- **Color Picker:** Styled HTML `<input type="color">` with custom dimensions and border styling.
- **Clear Button:** Modern gradient background with hover scaling and shadow effects.
- **Canvas:** Full-page responsive drawing area with subtle inner shadows and rounded corners.
- **Font:** Clean, sans-serif 'Poppins' font loaded via Google Fonts.
- **Responsive Design:** Media queries optimize layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop.
